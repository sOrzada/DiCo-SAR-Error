These are the scripts for the calculation of the error in SAR calculation caused by the finite directivity of directional couplers in MRI.
The code uses a modified version of the rQstar by Vincent Gras.

This code is for the paper "On the measurement errors in SAR supervision introduced by directional couplers" by
Stephan Orzada, Thomas M. Fiedler, Jan Kesting, Max Joris Hubmann and Mark E. Ladd
Submitted to Magnetic Resonance in Medicine as a Technical Note.
